## White Space Collapsing

In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often add extra spaces or start some elements on a new line. When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly, if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as <b>white space collapsing</b>. You will often see that web page authors take advantage of white space collapsing to indent their code in order to make it easier to follow. 


## Linebreaks

As you have already seemn, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag:

```
<p> This what a line break tag looks like in a markdown file </p>

<br/>

<p>The above tag is used to add a line break to the middle of a paragraph in HTML</p>
```

## Horizontal Rules and Empty elements

To create a break between themes -- such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play-- you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the following tag:

```
<hr />
```

Thre are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as <b>empty elements</b> and they are written differently. An element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and forward slash character. Some web page authors miss this out but it is a good habit to get into.
